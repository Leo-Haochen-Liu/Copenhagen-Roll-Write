This supplementary material includes two PDF files, providing additional content related to the formative research (Material 1) and user studies (Material 2) presented in the paper. 

## Formative Research (Material 1)

Material 1 contains sketches of visual representations for everyday object AI agents created by workshop participants, along with their insights into the reasoning behind their designs. 


## User Studies  (Material 2)

Material 2 documents the detailed dialogues between users and the three everyday object AI agents (a plant, a pillow, and an apple) during the evaluation of the prototype system.
