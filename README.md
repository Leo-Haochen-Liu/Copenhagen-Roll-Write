# Copenhagen: Roll & Write Game
This is a project done in a team of 2. We built it to practice our coding skills, so the game rules are intentionally complex.

## Game Overview
In ***Copenhagen: Roll & Write***, players take turns rolling dice and strategically placing polyomino tiles to complete a building facade. By carefully selecting dice colors and tile shapes, you aim to fill rows and columns, unlocking special abilities and earning points along the way. The game includes various strategic elements, such as using bonuses and managing abilities, to enhance gameplay depth.

For a detailed explanation of the rules, please refer to the `copenhagen_r+w_en.pdf` in the `assets` folder. Additional game instructions are available in `user_manual.md`.
